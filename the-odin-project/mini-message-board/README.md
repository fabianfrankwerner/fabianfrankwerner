# Tasks

- [ ] Set up a basic Express app by installing Express and EJS. Set up a basic index route and run your server. Create the required folders and files as discussed in the previous lessons.
- [x] We are going to have 2 routes, the index ("/") and a “new message” form ("/new").
- [x] Create an array at the top of your index router called messages and put a couple of sample messages inside of it.
- [ ] Next, in your index template (in the "views" folder) loop through the messages array and for each one, display the user, text and the date the message was added. Don’t forget to make your messages available to your template by including it in the res.render ‘locals’ object (e.g. res.render("index", { title: "Mini Messageboard", messages: messages })).
