# From the Deep

In this problem, you'll write freeform responses to the questions provided in the specification.

## Random Partitioning

Random partitioning distributes observations evenly across all boats regardless of collection time patterns, as shown in Image 2 where early morning observations (00:00:xx timestamps) are distributed across all three boats rather than concentrated on one. This provides excellent load balancing even when most observations occur between midnight and 1am. However, to query all observations from a specific time range (like midnight to 1am), researchers must search all three boats since related data is scattered across the entire fleet, increasing query complexity and network traffic. This approach sacrifices query efficiency for consistent workload distribution.

## Partitioning by Hour

Partitioning by hour creates highly efficient time-based queries since researchers can target specific boats for specific timeframes. As visible in Image 3, all observations between midnight and 1am are stored exclusively on Boat A (Hours 0-7), allowing a researcher to query just one boat instead of all three. However, this approach creates severe data imbalance â€“ Boat A stores four observations while Boat B has none and Boat C has only two. Since AquaByte collects most observations between midnight and 1am, Boat A will continually receive disproportionately more data, potentially leading to storage constraints and performance bottlenecks while Boats B and C remain underutilized.

## Partitioning by Hash Value

Hash-based partitioning achieves balanced data distribution while enabling efficient queries for specific timestamps. As shown in Image 4, observations from the same time period (like midnight to 1am) are distributed across all boats based on their hash values rather than their collection times. This approach evenly distributes the storage load regardless of when observations occur. For exact timestamp queries (like 2023-11-01 00:00:01.020), researchers can compute its hash value (45) and know to query only Boat A (Values 0-499), increasing efficiency. However, time-range queries remain inefficient since observations from any given time period will hash to values across all three boats, requiring queries to all boats. This strategy optimizes for both load balancing and point queries at the cost of range query performance.
